## R excercise.Load the data set SoreThroat.dat available on MyCourses under Assigmnents:
```{r}
SoreThroat<-read.table("SoreThroat.dat",header=TRUE)
attach(SoreThroat)
```
## In this data set, the response variable Y describes whether a patient having surgery experienced a sore throat on waking (1 = "yes", 0 = "no"). The explanatory variables are D, a continuous variable giving the duration of the surgery in minutes, and T, a factor variable with levels 1 = "Tracheal tube", 0 = "Laryngeal mask airway" indicating the type of device used to secure the airway.  
## (a) Fit a GLM to the data, using the intercept, D, T, and the interaction between D and T. Write down the model for the probability of experiencing a sore throat on waking and interpret it (qualitative statements are fully sufficient).

```{r}
# probability of experiencing a sore throat
# use the Gaussian GLM
Y<-SoreThroat$Y
D<-SoreThroat$D
T0<- factor(SoreThroat$T)
logitmod<- glm(cbind(Y,1-Y)~D+T0+T0*D,family=binomial,x=TRUE)
summary(logitmod)
```
  
We are using the binomial GLM with canonical link here, so $g(\mu_i)=log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\eta_i$.
The probability of experiencing a sore throat P will be $log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = 0.366973+0.09062D-3.19094T$ and $P=\frac{p}{1-p}$. The P is approximatly the probability of Y=1. If the probability is higher than 0.5, then it is more likely to have a sore throat and otherwise it is more likely to have no sore throat.
  
## (b)If $\widehat{\beta}$ denotes that parameter pertaining to the interaction, construct a 95% confidence interval for $\widehat{\beta}$
```{r}
# construct the 95% CI
I<-t(logitmod$x)%*%diag(logitmod$weights)%*%(logitmod$x)
I.inv<-solve(I)

sd<-sqrt(diag(I.inv))
# here we want 95% CI 
z<-qnorm(0.975)
beta<-logitmod$coefficients

c.upper<-beta+z*sd
c.lower<-beta-z*sd
CI<- cbind(c.lower,c.upper)
colnames(CI)<-c("2.5%","97.5%")
CI
```
  
Then the 95% confidence interval for each paraeters is shown above, the 95% confidence interval for $\widehat{\beta}$ is [-0.0386,0.1878].

## (c)Using (i) a Wald test and (ii) a likelihood ratio test, test whether the interaction between D and T is significant. Test at the 5% level.  
For (i) wald test, we build a new model by adding a connection between D and T. Then if 
```{r}
library(Matrix)
#test whether each beta=0 using Wald tests
beta/sd
pchisq((beta/sd)^2,df=1,lower.tail=FALSE)
```
  
Then we can see that the p-value is 0.1966>0.05, so the null hypothsis is sitting in the 95% convidence interval.Then the null hypothesis should not be rejected, so the interaction between D and T is not significant.  
```{r}
# use the likelihood ratio test
logit_new1<-glm(cbind(Y,1-Y)~D+T0,family=binomial,x=TRUE)
L1<--2*(logLik(logit_new1)-logLik(logitmod))
L1
p.val<-pchisq(L1,df=1,lower.tail=FALSE)
p.val
```
  
The p value is equal to 0.1777>0.05, we should accpet the hull hypothsis that the interation is not significant.
  
## (d)Using (i) a Wald test and (ii) a likelihood ratio test, test whether the interaction between D and T and T are significant predictors (that is, whether we can remove T from the model altogether). Test at the 5% level.

```{r}
#Wald test
var<-solve(I.inv[3:4,3:4])
beta<-logitmod$coefficients
beta2<-c(beta[3:4])
W<-t(beta2)%*%var%*%(beta2)
pchisq(W,df=2,lower.tail=FALSE)
```
```{r}
#likelihood ratio test
logit_new2<-glm(cbind(Y,1-Y)~D,family=binomial,x=TRUE)
L2<--2*(logLik(logit_new2)-logLik(logitmod))
L2
p.val<-pchisq(L2,df=2,lower.tail=FALSE)
p.val

```
  
According to the Wald test, we have 0.129>0.05 and the likelihood ratio test shows that 0.0696>0.05. We accept the null hypothesis test that the interaction of D and T and T are not significant, so T can beremoved from the model.
